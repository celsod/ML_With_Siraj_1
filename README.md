# ML_With_Siraj_1
First project from the ML course with Siraj

This is the first project from the Making Money with ML course from Siraj Raval.

I used the flask web-app as provided by mtobeiyf.

I used the fashion MNIST data set and built a CNN using the tutorial from tensorflow and the example from sallubhai on Github.
I ran into a problem when I created the CNN because I did not think to reshape the data set to fit into the Conv2D layers of the CNN.
After using sallubhai's example of preprocessing, my model started to work.  My latest model, which is the one set in the web app, has a
test accuracy of 59.08%.
